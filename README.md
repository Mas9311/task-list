# List of Tasks #

Consolidate your todo lists.<br>

## Usage ##

 1. [Download this repo](https://github.com/Mas9311/task-list/archive/v1.0.1.zip), and open a Terminal window.
 1. <code>unzip</code> the new <code>task-list-1.0.1.zip</code> file, then delete the zip.
    - I recommend creating a ~/Software/ folder so your applications don't accumulate in <code>~/Downloads</code> or <code>~/Desktop</code>.
    - Move the <code>task-list-1.0.1</code> folder to <code>~/Software/</code>.
 3. <code>cd</code> into the <code>task-list-1.0.1</code> folder.
 1. To run the menu-driven program, type <code>python3 run.py</code>
 1. Or to *just* print all of your lists, type <code>python3 run.py print</code>


## Create an Alias ##

Personally, I don't want to <code>cd</code> into the <code>~/Software/task-list-1.0.1</code> folder and type <code>python3 run.py</code> every time to run the menu program, so follow these steps to create both aliases.<br>
I named mine <code>tasks</code> and <code>ptasks</code>, short for *print tasks*.<br>

*Note: only one version of this program can be in <code>~/Software/</code> at a time.*<br>
*If you've downloaded two versions of this program, move the preexisting <code>my_lists/</code> folder to the newer version, then delete the older version entirely.*

#### Linux users ####

If you did not move the <code>task-list-1.0.1</code> folder into <code>~/Software/</code>, then don't forget to replace the path in the block of text found below.

 1. <code>nano ~/.profile</code> to see and edit your current aliases.
 1. Copy the following block:
<pre># task-list program aliases
alias tasks="cd ~/Software/task-list*/; python3 run.py"
alias ptasks="cd ~/Software/task-list*/; python3 run.py print"</pre>
 3. Paste the text into the file. I recommend grouping your custom aliases together at the bottom of the file.
 1. Save your changes. If you're using the <code>nano</code> editor, press \[Ctrl X] to exit, \[Y] to save, then \[Enter] to save the name of the file as is.
 1. <code>source ~/.profile</code> to make your new aliases visible.
 1. Now you can type, in Terminal, the name of your new aliases from any folder to execute the corresponding commands.

###### Create a Desktop Launcher #####

Follow the following steps to create a launcher for <code>tasks</code>.<br>
*Note: You can follow this same recipe for <code>ptasks</code> as well*.

 1. Right click an open spot on the Desktop.
 1. Select \[Create Launcher...].
<pre>Name: Task-List
Command: tasks
[âœ“] Run in Terminal</pre>
 2. Click \[Create].
 1. Open the new launcher and click \[Mark Executable] when prompted.
